# MASHt - MASH toolkit

Python toolkit for the MASH tool and streamlined statistical analysis for Linux.

## Description

This toolkit serves to automate work that includes MASH.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

- Python (tested on 3.10)
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - rpy2
  - statsmodels
- R
  - stats
  - broom
- mash (either in binary or installed in the environment)
- Linux OS (commands from the `stats` subcommand can also be run on Windows)

### Installation

No installation is necessary - the package should work right away.

## Executing the program

### mash module

- basic mash distance calculation (between the first and all of the rest of files in a specified directory):

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <path_to_dir> -d
    ```

    MASHt can also calculate distances between the first and the rest of specified files if `<path_to_dir>` is replaced with a `<path_to_file>`:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <path_to_file> -d
    ```

    The `<path_to_file>` file should list filenames relative to current directory, e.g.:

    ``` txt
    tests/data/seqs/1.fastq
    tests/data/seqs/3.fastq
    tests/data/seqs/5.fastq
    ```

    NB - the `<path_to_file>` file has to have a .txt extension!
- basic mash sketching (of all files in the specified directory into one sketch):

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <path_to_dir> -s
    ```

- mash sketching, saving to specified folder and viewing information on these sketches:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <path_to_dir> -s -i -o <output_dir>
    ```

- viewing info on all sketches in a folder:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <path_to_dir> -i
    ```

- calculating distances between all sequences in a selected sketch (lower portion of the distance matrix) and printing it to console:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <chosen_.msh_file> -t -v
    ```

- `--info` and `--triangle` options automatically work on the sketch file generated in the same command, e.g.:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash <dir_with_input_sequences> -s -t -i -o <output_dir>
    ```

    will create the sketch (.msh) file of all files within `dir_with_input_sequences/`, show information on them to the console and generate a `sketches_triangle.tsv` report file. The files will be stored in the `output_dir/`.
- parameters and options can be specified in a text file. Use `@<file_name>` to point to the file:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash @<file_name>
    ```

    `<file_name>` is relative to current directory, so:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht mash @test/args.txt
    ```

    will run masht mash with arguments provided in `args.txt` file within `./tests/` directory.
    `args.txt` should look something like this (note that there should be no trailing spaces on any of the lines!):

    ```text
    tests/data/seqs
    -s
    -o test_outputs
    -v
    ```

#### mash options (flags)

|option|long name|description|
|---|---|---|
|`-b`|`--bounds`|calculate Mash error bounds of selected files|
|`-d`|`--distance`|calculate mash distances between the first and all of the rest of selected files|
|`-h`|`--help`|show help message|
|`-i`|`--info`|show information on selected sketch files|
|`-m`|`--mash`|run mash with specified params (point to a mash binary in the beginning)|
|`-o`|`--output_dir`|location of output directory (default: '.')|
|`-s`|`--sketch`|create sketches of selected files|
|`-sc`|`--screen`|determine whether query sequences are within a sketch file|
|`-t`|`--triangle`|generate matrix of distances in a sketch|
|`-v`|`--verbose`|print more descriptions of performed actions to the console|

### stats module

- basic PCoA analysis:

    The simplest use case is to perform analysis on one triangle file generated by MASHt:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_triangle_file> -p -o <output_dir>
    ```

    One can also perform PCoA analysis on all files within `<path_to_dir>`:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_dir> -p -o <output_dir>
    ```

    MASHt can also perform PCoA analysis on specified files if `<path_to_dir>` is replaced with a `<path_to_file>`:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_file> -p
    ```

    The `<path_to_file>` file should list filenames relative to current directory, e.g.:

    ``` txt
    tests/data/triangle_one.tsv
    tests/data/triangle_two.tsv
    tests/data/triangle_three.tsv
    ```

    NB: the `<path_to_file>` file has to have a .txt extension!

  - number of dimensions is controlled with the `-n` option. Give an intiger to specify the number of dimensions or leave it empty to perform PCoA analysis on all dimensions:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_triangle_file> -p -n 4
    ```

- ANOVA/MANOVA analysis:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_pcoa_coords_file> -a -g <path_to_groups_file>
    ```

    Names of observations in `<path_to_groups_file>` file should be the same as in `<path_to_pcoa_coords_file>` file. The file should look something like this:

    |Sample|Genotype|Temp|Time|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |BWOT1dR2|BW|OT|1d|
    |BWOT1dR1|BW|OT|1d|
    |BWOT1dR3|BW|OT|1d|
    |BWOT10dR1|BW|OT|10d|
    |BWOT10dR2|BW|OT|10d|
    |BWOT10dR3|BW|OT|10d|

  - `<path_to_pcoa_coords_file>` file is automatically inferred to be the results file of PCoA analysis is `-p` option was chosen, so there is no need to specify it explicitly. You still have to provide the `<path_to_groups_file>` file, though:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_triangle_file> -p -a -g <path_to_groups_file>
    ```

    is equivalent to:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats <path_to_pcoa_coords_file> -a -g <path_to_groups_file>
    ```

    after the PCoA analysis is performed on `<path_to_triangle_file>` file.

    > NB: MANOVA analysis is performed using R via `rpy2` package to transpile code and objects (like dataframes) between R and Python. This makes the execution a bit slower, but testing showed that results of n-way MANOVA using `statsmodels` are not calculated correctly as of the time of writing this docs. Once the issue is resolved, the MANOVA analysis will be performed using statsmodels and execution time will improve.

- parameters and options can be specified in a text file. Use `@<file_name>` to point to the file:

    ```console
    foo@bar: python3 masht stats @test/args.txt
    ```

    The file should look something like this (note that there should be no trailing spaces on any of the lines!):

    ```txt
    tests/anova_tests/aov_triangle.tsv
    -p
    -v
    -o
    test_outputs/
    -d
    1
    9
    -ma
    tests/anova_tests/test_groups_file.tsv
    ```

    this analysis will perform PCoA analysis on `tests/anova_tests/aov_triangle.tsv` file, draw a plot with PC1 and PC9 on it, perform MANOVA analysis on the same file and print more descriptions of performed actions to the console.

### blaster module

All tasks related to BLAST (creation of index, blasting, splitting results by GO terms etc.) can be performed with one command. This way paths for input files for subsequent steps are inferred automatically. Example file with arguments would look like this:

```txt
--create_db
--db_fasta
../path/to/fasta_file_to_create_index_on
--name
test
--blast
--query
../path/to/file(s)_to_blast
--evalue
1e-49
--output_dir
test_outputs
--go_slim_list
../path/to/file(s)_with_go_terms
--split
../path/to/file(s)_with_sequences_to_split_by_go_terms
--verbose
```
